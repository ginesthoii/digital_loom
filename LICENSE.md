This repository and all associated materials—including but not limited to source code, binaries, firmware, AI models, datasets, documentation, designs, CAD/STL files, diagrams, images, text, branding, concepts, and any derivative digital or physical assets (collectively, the “Work”)—are proprietary and fully owned by the Licensor.
By accessing, viewing, downloading, cloning, or interacting with the Work in any capacity, you agree to the following terms in full.



## 1. Intellectual Property Rights

The Licensor retains exclusive ownership of all intellectual property rights in the Work, including:
	- implementation
  - design
  - architecture
  - structure
  - hardware layouts
  - schematics
  - firmware
  - datasets
  - AI model files
  - training configurations
  - images, textures, fonts
  - CAD/STL/3D assets
  - diagrams, documentation, and manuals
  - trade dress and branding
  - all non-public ideas and concepts

No rights or licenses are granted unless explicitly provided in writing and signed by the Licensor.



## 2. Prohibited Actions

Unless you have prior written permission, you may NOT:
  - copy, fork, clone, mirror, or replicate the Work
  - modify, adapt, rewrite, or translate the Work
  - redistribute or publish any portion of the Work
  - host or reupload the Work on any platform
  - incorporate any part of the Work into your own project
  - include the Work in AI training sets, datasets, corpora, or ML pipelines
  - analyze the Work for competitive replication
  - create derivative works, variations, or “inspired by” implementations
  - use the Work’s architecture, design system, or data schema to build your own
  - create commercial products or services based on this Work
  - upload, submit, or contribute modifications or pull requests
  - disassemble, decompile, reverse-engineer, or extract underlying logic
  - embed the Work in hardware devices, software products, or cloud services

Any attempt to bypass, alter, or ignore these restrictions is a violation of this Agreement.



## 3. Commercial Use, Reverse Engineering & Derivatives

Without explicit written permission, you may NOT:
	-	use the Work for commercial, business, academic, research, or paid purposes
	-	sell, license, rent, or monetize any portion of the Work
	-	use the Work as a template or reference for your own systems
	-	build competing versions, forks, or “similar tools”
	-	reconstruct or imitate the internal designs, styles, or methods
	-	extract datasets, assets, algorithms, or visual forms
	-	reuse even small portions of the Work (e.g., a function, a diagram, a module)

This includes both direct and indirect usage—such as recreating a system guided by the structure of this Work.



## 4. AI & Dataset Restrictions

You may NOT:
  - use the Work in any AI model training
  - embed the Work in machine learning datasets
  - fine-tune models using the Work
  - extract text, code, assets, or metadata for LLM use
  - convert parts of the Work into embeddings or vector indexes
  - use the Work to generate AI-assisted derivatives

These actions are considered unauthorized reproduction and directly violate this license.



## 5. Hardware, Maker, CAD, & Engineering Restrictions

You may NOT:
  - reproduce hardware designs, schematics, PCB layouts, or wiring diagrams
  - export, sell, print, or manufacture physical objects based on the Work
  - use 3D models (STL, OBJ, STEP, etc.) for printing or remixing
  - replicate circuits, sensors, housings, or mechanical assemblies
  - reproduce book-nook designs, engineering layouts, or fabrication notes

The Work is proprietary both in digital and physical form.



## 6. Security Tools & Software Restrictions

You may NOT:
  - reuse any part of this Work within penetration tools, scanners, or automation
  - create similar dashboards, workflows, modules, or patterns
  - analyze the Work for replication or competitive development
  - use the Work in commercial cybersecurity products

All security-related architecture and logic are protected.



## 7. Enforcement & Legal Remedies

Violating this Agreement constitutes infringement. The Licensor may pursue:
  - DMCA takedowns
  - removal of infringing content
  - civil litigation for damages
  - injunctions to halt use
